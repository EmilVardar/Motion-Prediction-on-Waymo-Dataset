# Motion-Prediction-on-Waymo-Dataset


This code has been created by Emil Vardar, Lovisa Byman and Eden Wang as a CS229 course project given at Stanford University.
The goal with the project is to predict the trajectory of 8 objects 8 seconds in the future by 1 second past context. The dataset
we used in this project is the Waymo open dataset given in [1].

To run the code, download it and run it on Google Colab
